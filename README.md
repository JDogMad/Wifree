## Documentation

You should be able to clone this project into your IDE, and run it directly.

Please note that because this is a school project, and we use a free key for the maps SDK, you will need to change it to your own key.

In the AndroidManifest.xml you will find tag with a key, that you will need to change. You can make an account on the Google Cloud Console, then going to the APIs & Services -> Library you can add the map SDK for android and generate a key.
